# hello-world
My name is Emmalyn, but people call me Emma. 

i love eggplants.  
Halo 3, LOL, TF2, or any game that is playable with friends  
BOARDGAMES are the shit   
Camping, but never did it before  
Tennis or any recreational activity  
I want to cliff dive someday, but I don't know how to swim  

Traveling is cool too  

Currently:   
	Undecided major in the Computing Sciences department  
Not sure what I want to do for my future, career, or tomorrow  
I like school surprisingly, but I still don't know what to do.  

However, I do have a goal...  

  Goal:   
    Pursue happiness and get paid for it.  

What I follow:  
"A day without laughter is a day wasted" - Charlie Chaplin  

Top 3 shows:   
  It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia  
  Game of Thrones   
  Silicon Valley  
  
Oh! and I don't plant eggplants, but someday I will for sure.
